# Overview
We build a hotel booking webapp that allows user to search for available rooms for our hotel and book rooms through the webapp.

# Details
When the user land on our home page, they will be able to search for rooms with certain range of dates and number of people, then they will be directed to the next page in which we will gather all the available that matches the condition user input from our database and show them to the user in a table, here user will be able to choose the room that they like. After selecting the room they like, they will be directed to the next page with confirmation information of the room they chose and they will be asked to input they information such as their name, phone number, address and so on. After user submitted their information, we will save all the data into our database and directed them to the final confirmation page where all the information will be shown for confirmation.
Among the processes, all the input that user provided will be validated to ensure the data is proper type and in valid format and also in order to prevent injection attacks.

# Future Work
We are planning to add more features to the applicatoin, some examples are like membership system to allow user to signup and signin, system admin system that allows system admin to login and check booking status and user information. More functions are currently under discussion.
